- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
For this application, the main purpose was to provide users with an inventory management application that allowed users to create
custom inventory items, modify the quantity of those inventory items, and delete those items as needed. To further build on the
app's functionality, it supports user account creation and SMS notifications that are sent whenever an item's inventory is
depleted.

- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs 
- keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
When the application is opened, it brings users to a login page that allows users to either log in with existing credentials or
register new credentials as needed. After successfully logging in or registering, the user is brought to the "main" page, the
inventory management screen. This features a scrolling cardview displaying each item's name and quantity along with buttons to
modify that item's quantity or delete it outright. In the top menu of this page, there are buttons to add new items or access
the page's settings. To ensure the UI is easy to use and accessible to users, labels support Android screen reading, aspects
such as inventory item cards are distinct from their backgrounds with separate but large elements, and UI elements offer
ergonomics whenever possible. Throughout testing, it was easy to access and modify the inventory database as needed.

- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
When coding this application, everything began with developing requirements based on user needs. From there, a rough user interface was
created to reflect these requirements and establish a framework for functionality. Finally, function development began. As development
continued and needs changed, the UI changed to reflect these changes, multiple approaches to storing global variables were tested and
refactored. After constant testing and debugging, the application was functional and met user needs.

- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
After a few lines of code were written, the application was built and tested. Error reports were parsed
constantly and dealt with in a short timespan. By constantly dealing with bugs as development continued, the need to revisit problems
later in development was greatly reduced and the completed project was more stable as a result.

- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Innovation was required when enabling permissions and storing the user's phone number. Initially, the approach was to use a phone
number database and a single variable in memory to determine if a user had the proper permissions to send SMS notifications.
Memory storage proved to be inefficient and less than desirable for a user and the phone number database was producing erratic
results when called to send an SMS message. As such, an SharedPreferences file was created to persistently handle both; while
implementation and research were challenging, this proved to be the right solution for the current implementation of this 
functionality.

- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
For this aspect, I believe my utilization of SQLite demonstrates my proficiency best. A SQLite database is used to store the
user's customized inventory objects and produces a way for the user to add or modify that database's values. This process
is efficient, scalable, and easy to read and modify in the way I implemented this technology.
